### Project progress as of 10-25-18

I have the raw data loaded to my computer

/c/Users/mcgom/Documents/GitHub/Tides_eDNA/data/Good-lib2_S2_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz


I have tried to upload the [PEAR program](https://sco.h-its.org/exelixis/web/software/pear/ "PEAR") to my computer which would be the first step on my workflow. Ramon suggested [another way](https://www.h-its.org/downloads/pear-academic/) to load it, 

/c/Users/mcgom/Documents/Bioinformatics/pear-0.9.11-linux-x86_64.tar.gz

but this has not worked either.

I spent several hours yesterday working on this issue and also getting my repository organized, created more folders and tried to get the repository cloned to my computer so they both "communicate", but I'll have to get some help with this.

I will try to check with Ramon before the weekend to see if it's work on my computer.

I'm working during class to see if I can get to what pear does with usearch instead. Kelly just toldm e that through the command line userach seems to have some commands that should work.

 
### Project progress as of 1-11-4-18

I realized this week, that with my Windows system I need to change strategy, so I will be performing most of the steps in my project using R.

I  met with Ramon on Monday 10-29, and he recomended a couple of packages that could work for most of the steps in the eDNA analysis of data for my project
insect and dada2. I decided to go with insect. So I loaded it to R studio. Following a tuturial with examples on the script and steps to follow I 
got the data to be read and got the primer values into R, But I was getting error messges for the next step, which would merge both library sequences.

After meeting again with Ramon on Friday 11-2, he suggested I try the PC at my lab. I was able to get it to run the merging step successfuly 
on Sunday 11-4!!!
