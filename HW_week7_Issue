I am not able to instal cutadapt in my computer, so I'm trying to do what Kelly did for her eDNA project (see her Jupyter notebook 
code below) with Galaxy.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 !cutadapt \
 -g file:/Users/kellycribari/Documents/Bioinformatics/GitHub/Cribari-eDNA/FASTA/metadatatags.fasta \
 -o /Users/kellycribari/Documents/Bioinformatics/GitHub/Cribari-eDNA/Demultiplexed/sample{name}.fasta \
 /Users/kellycribari/Documents/Bioinformatics/GitHub/Cribari-eDNA/FASTA/Lib-1.assembled.fasta \
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 What I would like to do is to use the metadata file she has in her code "metadatatags.fasta" with all the tags that need to be removed, 
 and do the same with Galaxy. I did a trial run in Galaxy, but I removed just one of the tags. I'm not sure if I could removed all of the 
 tags in one run and get just one file with all the tags removed, like Kelly did in Jupyter.
 
 The link for both my files (merged data and metadata file) in eagle is :
 eagle.fish.washington.edu log in and then open File station marta/eDNA
