I'm trying to do what Kelly did for her eDNA project here with Galaxy.
 !cutadapt \
 -g file:/Users/kellycribari/Documents/Bioinformatics/GitHub/Cribari-eDNA/FASTA/metadatatags.fasta \
 -o /Users/kellycribari/Documents/Bioinformatics/GitHub/Cribari-eDNA/Demultiplexed/sample{name}.fasta \
 /Users/kellycribari/Documents/Bioinformatics/GitHub/Cribari-eDNA/FASTA/Lib-1.assembled.fasta \
 
 What I would like to do is use the metadata file she has in her code "metadatatags.fasta" with all the tags that need to be removed, 
 and use it somehow in Galaxy. I did run a trial run in Galaxy, but I did one of the tags. I'm not sure if I could removed all of the 
 tags in one run and get just one file with all the tags removed, like Kelly did in Jupyter.
 
 The link for both my files in eagle is :
 eagle.fish.washington.edu log in and then go to File station marta folder and eDNA
